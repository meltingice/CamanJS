# Here it begins. Caman is defined.
# There are many different initialization for Caman, which are described on the 
# [Basic Usage](http://camanjs.com/docs) page.
#
# Initialization is tricky because we need to make sure everything we need is actually fully 
# loaded in the DOM before proceeding. When initialized on an image, we need to make sure that the 
# image is done loading before converting it to a canvas element and writing the pixel data. If we 
# do this prematurely, the browser will throw a DOM Error, and chaos will ensue. In the event that 
# we initialize Caman on a canvas element while specifying an image URL, we need to create a new 
# image element, load the image, then continue with initialization.
#
# The main goal for Caman was simplicity, so all of this is handled transparently to the end-user. 
# This is also why this piece of code is a bit gross. Once everything is loaded, and Caman is 
# initialized, the callback function is fired.
