<h1>About the Project</h1>
The main focus of CamanJS is manipulating images using the HTML5 canvas and Javascript. It's a combination of a simple-to-use interface with advanced and efficient image/canvas editing techniques. It is also completely library independent and can be safely used next to jQuery, YUI, Scriptaculous, MooTools, etc.

CamanJS is very easy to extend with new filters and plugins, and it comes with a wide array of image editing functionality, which is only growing as the community makes more plugins.

For more information, I highly recommend taking a look at the <a href="http://camanjs.com">official website</a> where there is more comprehensive documentation and interactive demos. You can also <a href="https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS/wiki">read the wiki</a> for some basic information about the project and how to use it.

<h2>CDN JS Hosting</h2>
CamanJS is hosted on CDN JS if you're looking for a CDN hosting solution. It is the full and minified version of the library, which means all plugins are included. Simply load CamanJS directly from <a href="http://ajax.cdnjs.com/ajax/libs/camanjs/2.0/caman.full.min.js">this URL</a> for usage on your site.

<h2>NodeJS Compatibility</h2>
There is now a version of CamanJS that is made to work with NodeJS.  It has all of the functionality of the normal browser version, including plugins.  Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/meltingice/CamanJS/tree/node">node branch</a> for more information.

<h1>Testing</h1>
CamanJS has both QUnit unit testing and a custom benchmarking page to monitor render times on a per-filter basis.  Simply open test/index.html for the QUnit tests, and test/benchmark.html for the benchmarking tests.
