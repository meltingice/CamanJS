         	<a href="camaninstance.html"><h3>Caman Instance</h3></a>
         	<p>This is the main class that you interact with once Caman is actaully initialized. It stores all of the important data relevant to a Caman-initialized canvas, and is also responsible for the actual initialization.</p>

         	<a href="events.html"><h3>Events</h3></a>
         	<p>The event system in Caman is responsible for registering and firing events at certain points during the render process. It is fairly straightforward and consists of a <tt>listen()</tt> and <tt>trigger()</tt> function.</p>

         	<p>Responsible for storing all of the filters</p>
         	
         	<a href="filters.html"><h3>Filters</h3></a>
         	<p>The filters define all of the built-in functionality that comes with Caman (as opposed to being 
         	provided by a plugin). All of these filters are ratherbasic, but are extremely powerful when
         	many are combined. For information on creating plugins, check out the 
         	<a href="http://camanjs.com/docs/plugin-creation">Plugin Creation</a> page, and for information on using 
         	the plugins, check out the <a href="http://camanjs.com/docs/built-in">Built-In Functionality</a> page.</p>

         	<a href="layers.html"><h3>Layer (Coffeescript)</h3></a>
         	 <p>The entire layering system for Caman resides in this file. Layers get their own canvasLayer 
         	object which is created when newLayer() is called. For extensive information regarding the 
         	specifics of howthe layering system works, there is an in-depth blog post on this very topic.

         	<p>This is actually where the Caman object is defined, and is where the Caman initialization code resides. There are many different initialization for Caman, which are described on the Basic Usage page.</p>

         	<p>Simple console logger class that can be toggled on and off based on Caman.DEBUG</p>
         	
         	<a href="pixelInfo.html"><h3>Pixel Info</h3></a>
         	<p>This object is available inside of the <tt>process()</tt> loop, and it lets filter developers have simple access to any arbitrary pixel in the image, as well as information about the current pixel in the loop.</p>

         	<p>CamanJS's rendering system. This covers convolution kernels, pixel-wise filters, and plugins. All of the actual pixel/image manipulation is executed here when <tt>render()</tt> is called.</p>
         	
         	<a href="renderjob.html"><h3>Render Job</h3></a>
         	<p>Handles all of the various rendering methods in Caman. Most of the image modification happens here. A new RenderJob object is created for every render operation.</p>
